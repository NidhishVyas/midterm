# Calculator Application - *Midterm Project*

## Introduction

This project houses a versatile calculator application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and managing calculation history. Designed with extendability in mind, it utilizes a plugin-based architecture to facilitate easy addition of new functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NidhishVyas/midterm
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd midterm
   ```
3. Activate virtual environment
   ```sh
   cd git_python_testing_setup_homework
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

Execute the main script to start the application:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Usage Examples

Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with the Main Menu. Here's how to navigate through its features:

### Main Menu

- To access the calculator, type `1` or `calculator`.
- To manage your calculation history, type `2` or `history`.

### Performing Calculator Operations

##### Addition:

1. From the Main Menu, enter `1` or `calculator`.
2. Choose `1` or `add`.
3. Enter the first number, then the second number. The result will be displayed.

##### Subtraction, Multiplication, Division:

- Follow similar steps as for Addition, but choose the corresponding operation.

### History Management

##### Clearing History:

1. From the Main Menu, enter `2` or `history`.
2. In the History Menu, choose `1` to remove all history entries.

##### Deleting a Specific Entry:

- Choose `2`, then follow the prompt to enter the index of the entry you wish to delete.

#### Viewing History:

- Choose `3` to view all past calculations.

## Architectural Decisions

The application adopts a modular and plugin-based architecture, enabling seamless integration and management of calculator operations and history functionalities. This design promotes scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Design Patterns

- **Command Pattern**: Utilized for implementing calculator operations and history management commands, facilitating easy addition and modification of functionalities.
- **Plugin Pattern**: Employs a dynamic discovery and loading mechanism for plugins, supporting extensibility by allowing new calculator operations or history commands to be added without altering the core application logic.

## Logging Strategy

Logging is configured via `logging.conf`, offering a flexible and centralized approach to managing log messages generated by the application. This strategy is crucial for debugging, monitoring application behavior, and auditing usage patterns.

## Testing

Tests are written using pytest. Run the following command to execute all tests:

```sh
pytest
```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

The `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` file configures the CI/CD pipeline, automating tests and deployment processes. This ensures code quality and facilitates smooth deployment to production environments.

## Conclusion

This calculator application exemplifies a clean, modular design that can easily accommodate future expansion. Its logging and testing practices further underscore a commitment to quality and maintainability.
